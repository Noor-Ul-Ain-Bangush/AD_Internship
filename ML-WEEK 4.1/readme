In this task, we build a simple neural network using TensorFlow and Keras for classifying images from the Fashion MNIST dataset, which consists of grayscale images of clothing articles. 
We start by preparing and normalizing the data, then construct a neural network with one hidden layer and compile it with appropriate loss functions and optimizers.
The model is trained with validation and evaluated on a test set, where performance is further analyzed using metrics like accuracy and a confusion matrix.
