ABSTRACT: "This task involves implementing and 
comparing decision tree and random 
forest classifiers for predicting loan 
approvals using the Loan Prediction 
Dataset from Kaggle. The process 
includes data cleaning, feature encoding, 
model training, and evaluation using 
accuracy, F1-score, precision, and recall. 
Visualization of the decision tree and 
comparison of model performance 
metrics provide insights into their 
effectiveness."
